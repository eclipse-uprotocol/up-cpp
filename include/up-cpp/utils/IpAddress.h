/// @brief Utility for converting IP addresses between representations and for
///        normalizing string representations.
///
/// IP addresses can be represented as either human-readable strings or binary
/// numbers, and may be either IPv4 or IPv6. Additionally, each address family
/// has multiple allowable string representations. For example these IPv6
/// addresses are all the same:
///
///   * `2001::C0FF:EE01`
///   * `2001:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:c0ff:ee01`
///   * `2001:0000:0000:0000::0000:192.255.238.1`
///
/// This class provides three utilities:
///
///   1. Given a string, it will detect if it contains an IP address and which
///      family (IPv4 or IPv6) it contains.
///   2. Given a string IP address, it will convert the address to its binary
///      representation.
///   3. Given a binary representation of an IP address, it will convert it
///      to a string.
///   4. In all cases, it will produce a consistent, normalized string
///      representation of an IP address.
///
/// Point #4 is particularly important in any scenario where a direct string
/// match is used on an address, such as in the Zenoh URI <-> Topic mapping
/// (https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-spec/blob/main/up-l1/zenoh.adoc).
