# uProtocol C++ Interface Library (up-cpp)

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-cpp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=v1.0_up-v1.6.0)](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-cpp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Welcome!

This library provides the primary interface to uProtocol for uEntity
applications. The primary point of interaction for most applications will be the
layer 2 "communications" objects.

In addition to `up-cpp`, a uEntity will also need at least on transport
implementation, such as [up-transport-zenoh-cpp][zenoh-transport-repo].

*_IMPORTANT NOTE:_ This project is under active development*

## Getting Started

### Requirements:
- Compiler: GCC/G++ 11 or Clang 13
- Conan : 1.59 or latest 2.x

#### Conan packages

Using the recipes found in [up-conan-recipes][conan-recipe-repo], build these
Conan packages:

1. [up-core-api][spec-repo]: `conan create --version 1.6.0-alpha2 --build=missing up-core-api/release`

**NOTE:** all `conan` commands in this document use  Conan 2.x syntax. Please
adjust accordingly when using Conan 1.x.

## How to Use the Library

To add up-cpp to your conan build dependencies, place following in your
[conanfile.txt][conan-txt-reference]:

```
[requires]
up-cpp/[~1.0]

[generators]
CMakeDeps
CMakeToolchain

[layout]
cmake_layout
```

**NOTE:** If using conan version 1.59 Ensure that the conan profile is
configured to use ABI 11 (libstdc++11: New ABI) standards according to
[the Conan documentation for managing gcc ABIs][conan-abi-docs].

## Building locally

The following steps are only required for developers to locally build and test
up-cpp, If you are making a project that uses up-cpp, follow the steps in the
[How to Use the Library](#how-to-use-the-library) section above.

### With Conan for dependencies

From the root of this repo, run:

```bash
conan install --build=missing .
cmake --preset conan-release
cd build/Release
cmake --build . -- -j
```

Once the build completes, tests can be run with `ctest`.

Debug builds can be generated by changing those steps to:

```bash
conan install --build=missing --settings=build_type=Debug .
cmake --preset conan-debug
cd build/Debug
cmake --build . -- -j
```

### Generate UT Coverage

To get code coverage, perform the steps above, but replace `cmake --preset...` with
```
cd build/Release
cmake ../../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=generators/conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage
```
Once the tests complete, the Unit Test Coverage report can be generated from the base up-cpp folder with: ./Coverage.sh
```
./coverage.sh
```

### With dependencies installed as system libraries

**TODO** Verify steps for pure cmake build without Conan.

### Creating the Conan package

See: [up-conan-recipes][conan-recipe-repo]
